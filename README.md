# Purpose of this Repo 
Where I work we use PowerPoint to make the Room Assignments for the day to day running of the Hockey Arena. 

The Batch file is used immediately after creating the PowerPoint to automate the process of:
1. Running the VBScript to split the 7 (or more) slides into 4K JPGs that can then be displayed on the signage in the arena lobby
2. Removing the old files from the remote access locations
3. Renaming the files based on the criteria of "1 == Monday" and so on
4. Closing the PowerPoint incase the VBScript fails to do so
